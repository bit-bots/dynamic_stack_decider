# dynamic_stack_decider

A leightweight framework for decision making and behavior defining for robots and other agents in chnaging enviroments. It combines the advantages of behavior trees, decision trees and state machines.


Programming:

    * Modeling of the behavior in a modular DAG
    * Simple Definitoin of thresholds and connections via yaml files.
        * Reprogramming software within seconds
    * Python for core logic using as-complex-as wished decions
    * Stack based architecture to structure the execution flow
