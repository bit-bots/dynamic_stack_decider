Dynamic Stack Decider
=====================

The Dynamic Stack Decider (DSD) is a framework for programming robot behavior. It can very roughly be described as something between a state machine and a behavior tree.
More information about the general idea and also on how to implement a DSD can be found in the :download:`corresponding paper<_static/dsd_paper_draft.pdf>`.

Besides the package for the DSD implementation there is another package for DSD visualization in rqt. It can be started as any normal plugin and is very self explanatory.
